- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rexy7
I'm new to the Programming/Developing commiunty. Currently learning Python as my 1st programming language learned. 
Made a Github account so I could collbrate and learn from others. Hopefully in 6 months time I am an advanced programmer in Python. 
Then learn an another language that is in demand, so I can receive job offers then continue to learn other languges to become the best programmer I can be!
